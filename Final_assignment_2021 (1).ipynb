Make sure that the factor is expressed as a monthly return (i.e., it should equal the difference in average stock returns betwen firms with high and low values of your proposed variable). **Note:** Use the same proposed variable as in all steps above, even if the evidence in **Step 3(i)** suggests it may not work as a factor.  \n",
    "- 2. Merge your factor into factor_data.txt. Estimate a 4-factor model, using the same 6 portfolios as in pandas_commands_lecture5 notebook (from the file portfolio_returns6.txt). You only need to estimate this for years when your factor is available, i.e., before 1990. Provide a summary of the estimates, and briefly state whether your 4-factor model appears to work better than the 3-factor model.\n",
    "- 3. Now use only the 3 standard factors from factor_data.txt, but create at least 4 non-linear variables based on these factors (e.g., you can multiply the factors by each other or take the square/cube of each factor). Estimate four different factor regressions, using all months from 1965 through 1990. Each regression should include the original 3 factors, plus at least one of the non-linear variables. Provide a summary of the estimates. Then, choose the regression model that works best, and re-esimate this model using all months from 1991 onward. Briefly explain whether the model you chose works well out of sample."
